# labgrind

**labgrind** is a web-based lab management suite intended for use by hackerspaces and open-community labs of all kinds. The software takes care of common tasks including tracking the lab credentials, skillsets, and inventory shared among organization members, along with providing a portal for members to collaborate on their projects.

**labgrind** is being developed for the Georgia Institute of Technology class CS3651: The Art of Prototyping Intelligent Appliances, and will also be used for the student-run lab modeled after the class as time goes on.
